## This is C# .NET Core tamplate

This project contains jwt auth that already set up.
It also has jwt roles auth. You can set up your custom roles.
It also has api "Wallet". This endpoints was made just to show how it works.
You can also dowload POST MAN exports and use them on this api.

To authenticate use this username and password:

##### testusername
##### testpassword

I also want to implemet refresh token functionality in the future.
